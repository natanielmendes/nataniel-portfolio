    title: About Me

    content: |-
      The term DevOps holds immense value to me as it reflects my expertise in both development and operations. After starting my journey as a Full Stack Developer in 2014, I integrated DevOps into my work routine in 2018. Since then, I have effectively deployed resources on AWS using Terraform, created CI/CD pipelines, and managed Kubernetes in production environments. By leveraging my development skills, I have successfully assisted countless developers in enhancing their operations experience and delivering superior software outcomes.
      Currently, I'm working on a project that promotes healthy and sustainable design practices, aiming to improve people's lives in the society.
